Was ist das?
============

A small rework of the Time Tracker plugin for Firefox to track time spent on Lepra related sites (also known as "2Pac" Time).

Installation
============

Download the xpi file. Then open it with Fire Fox. Enjoy!

Configure
=========

The default settings regard any URL that contains the word "lepra" or "lepro" as hard-core 2Pac time, this can be finetuned in the settings dialog (accessible via right click on the mask in the status bar).

Enjoy!
